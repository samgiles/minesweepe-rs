# minesweepe-rs

A minesweeper clone written in one evening to practice quick "straight to the point" code. So this code is not perfect!

### New things I tried:

- [iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/) GUI library
  - It has really high CPU usage, I'm probably doing something wrong.
  - I really like how you model UIs with this!
